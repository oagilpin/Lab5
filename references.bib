title = "Global production patterns: Understanding the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture greening and climate variability",
abstract = "Climate change due to increased greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the atmosphere has been consistently observed since the mid-20th century. The profound influence of global climate change on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, encompassing carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), has established a vital feedback loop that contributes to further climate change. This intricate relationship necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the underlying feedback mechanisms. By examining the interactions between global climate change, soil, and GHG emissions, we can elucidate the complexities of CO2, CH4, and N2O dynamics and their implications. In this study, we evaluate the global climate change relationship with GHG globally in 246 countries. We find a robust positive association between climate and GHG emissions. By 2100, GHG emissions will increase in all G7 countries and China while decreasing in the United Kingdom based on current economic growth policies, resulting in a net global increase, suggesting that climate-driven increase in GHG and climate variations impact crop production loss due to soil impacts and not provide climate adaptation. The study highlights the diverse strategies employed by G7 countries in reducing GHG emissions, with France leveraging nuclear power, Germany focusing on renewables, and Italy targeting its industrial and transportation sectors. The UK and Japan are making significant progress in emission reduction through renewable energy, while the US and Canada face challenges due to their industrial activities and reliance on fossil fuels.",
